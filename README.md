http-concat
=================

Overview
--------

This plugin is in beta, so your mileage may vary. It is based on a plugin from [Automattic](https://github.com/Automattic/) called [nginx-http-concat](https://github.com/Automattic/nginx-http-concat).
It differs slightly, as it doesn't require nginx and should work with most standard WordPress setups.
